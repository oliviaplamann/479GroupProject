# Introduction

Social media platforms like Twitter are an outlet for many individuals to express themselves, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are interested in analyzing Tweet Sentiment and Hashtags throughout the pandemic, and how these trends relate to COVID-19 case counts and restriction periods. We answered this by parallelizing our computations using the High Performance Computing Cluster (HPC) using shell scripting and R code.  With this code, we ran linear and logistic regressions on COVID-19 case counts and restrictions, produced time series graphs focusing on Tweet Sentiment and bar plots to visualize the most common hashtags in 2022. 

# Data Preparation and Cleaning

We obtained our data from a GitHub repository containing an ongoing collection of Tweets associated with COVID-19 that began in January 2022.  Almost 3 billion Tweets were collected using Twitter’s trending topics and selected keywords from each month, day, and hour of the year. We performed statistical analysis on the Hashtag and Sentiment files which were about 50 GB in size.  We utilized parallel computing in the HPC to read in and merge all the Hashtag and Sentiment files.  Then, we mutated the files by adding date and count columns for each sentiment to get the files into a suitable format for our statistical analysis.

# Statistical Computation

## Linear Regression

For the statistical computations, we first ran a linear regression model to investigate the relationship between counts of negative sentiment Tweets and COVID-19 cases from January 2020 to March 2022. It resulted in a p-value of 0.783 signifying no relationship between the two variables.  

However, when we graphed these variables, we found that a subset of the months seemed to show similar trends.

Based on these findings, we subsetted the data according to the visualized pattern of the graph and ran another linear regression. The new linear regression produced a p-value of 0.0179, signifying a strong relationship between the number of negative Tweets and the number of Covid cases during the time period of November 2020 to December 2021.

## Logistic Regression

Next, we ran a logistic regression model to see if there was an association between the count of negative Tweets and COVID restrictions in place. Restriction status was determined by societal restrictions in the United States and Europe where most of the data is collected from. This logistic regression resulted in a p-value of 0.0101, indicating a significant correlation between the count of negative Tweets and Covid restrictions.

Lastly, we created a boxplot of the distributions of negative Tweets according to restriction status to visualize the effect restriction status has on counts of negative Tweets.

# Visualizations

## Total Tweet Analysis

![](total.jpg)

We noticed the counts of negative and neutral Tweets were higher, with the peak of negativity coming around July 2020 amist the first summer of the pandemic.

While incomplete for several months in 2022, we notice a gradual increase in the total number of negative Tweets for 2020, as well as the cyclic pattern illustrated in 2021 and partially in 2022.

## Hashtag Analysis

After delving into the relationships between negative Tweets and COVID cases and restrictions, we wanted to consider hashtag use.  We found the 20 most commonly used hashtags in 2022 and made a barplot of hashtags against their frequency.

As we anticipated, #covid was the most commonly used hashtag in 2022 and was presented as a strong outlier.  Because of the #covid outlier skewing our graph, we decided to remove it in order to get a stronger visualization of the remaining 19 most commonly used hashtags in 2022 thus far.

Removing the #covid outlier gave us a stronger sense of how often the remaining 19 hashtags were used.  However, arguably 11 of the 20 hashtags were pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The evolution of the use of covid related hashtag all follow the same rise and constant use throughout the course of the pandemic.  

# Job Description
Our jobs typically took around 5-10 minutes to complete, but drastically increased to about an hour or more as more individuals ran their computations on Slurm. We were able to use the default 4 GB of memory per CPU allocated on the Slurm scheduler for all of our jobs.

From our analysis, we learned a significant amount about Tweet Sentiment and Hashtags during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, there certainly are weaknesses in our analysis. For example, we are putting trust in the sentiment analysis method the creators of the dataset chose. While the algorithm has a good reputation, we did not perform the deep learning computations ourselves and are putting trust into someone else’s work for our analysis which may result in problems rolling over.

# Conclusion

In light of our analysis, we learned that there is a significant relationship between negative Tweets and the count of COVID cases specifically from November 2020 to December 2021.  We also learned the relationship between number of negative Tweets and restriction status was significant.  From the time series, the high count and ratios of negative and neutral Tweets on the Twitter platform remained consistent each year.  We found that #covid is the most common hashtag of 2022 thus far, and is a strong outlier compared to other common hashtags.  In future work, we might find it interesting to focus on a subset in time like the events occurring in Ukraine, the Olympics, or even the Superbowl.
